We implement this technique using what are commonly known as Lagrange Equations, named after the French mathematician who derived the equations in the early 19th century. The method requires being able to express the kinetic and potential energies of rigid bodies, as well as the virtual work done by non-conservative external forces, referred to as generalized forces. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} Postage stamp of Joseph-Louis Lagrange to honor the French mathematician who derived the Lagrange equations.

### Lecture Videos

*   Watch [Notation Systems]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/notation-systems-2)
    *   From this class forward, Prof. Vandiver uses a different notation system. Please watch this video to see how the different notation systems interrelate.

*   Watch [Lecture 15: Introduction to Lagrange With Examples]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/lecture-15-introduction-to-lagrange-with-examples)
    *   Video Chapters
        *   [Generalized coordinate definitions]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/generalized-coordinate-definitions)
        *   [Complete, independent and holonomic]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/complete-independent-and-holonomic)
        *   [Example problems]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/example-problems)

### Recitation Video and Notes

*   Watch [Recitation 8: Cart and Pendulum, Lagrange Method]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/recitation-8-cart-and-pendulum-lagrange-method)
    *   This recitation covers a Lagrange approach to a problem involving a cart and pendulum.
*   [Recitation 8 Notes: Cart and Pendulum (Lagrange) (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/mit2_003scf11_rec8notes1)
    *   These recitation notes were compiled by Prof. David Gossard, another instructor for the course. His notes go over concepts and problems covered during the recitation sections he taught, and may not precisely correspond to the content covered in the above recitation video.
